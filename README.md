## Problem statement

Forecasting predicts the number of sales in the future. Having the right amount of products in stock is a core 
challenge in retail. A good forecast makes sure there are enough of your favourite products in stock, even if you come 
to the store late in the evening.

In this project, you will use a subset of M5 Forecasting - Accuracy hierarchical sales data from Walmart at one store, 
TX3 in the State of Texas, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The 
data include item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables 
such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Altogether, it can be used to improve forecasting 
accuracy.

## Data

The subset of M5 dataset, generously made available by Walmart, involves the unit sales of various products sold in 
the USA, more specifically, the dataset involves the unit sales of 3,049 products, classified into 3 product categories 
(Hobbies, Foods, and Household) and 7 product departments, in which the above-mentioned categories are disaggregated.

For this project, the selected products, Food3, are sold by TX3 store, located in Texas.

The dataset consists of the following five (5) files:

- `calendar_afcs2023.csv` contains information about the dates the products are sold
- `sell_prices_afcs2023.csv` contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date
- `sales_train_validation_afcs2023.csv` contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store
- `sales_test_validation_afcs2023.csv`  contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store
- `sales_test_validation_afcs2023.csv` contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store
